js fullcalendar with dropdown menu to pick up a month


Here I provide basically four ways to implement a dropdown menu into the 
<a href="https://fullcalendar.io/">js-fullcalender library</a>. It is a button in the header menu which allows you to navigate through months.
My implementation is not based on v2.6, however it should work for the very latest and also previous versions. 

So you see the implementations in the html files:

fullcalendar-select-menu:  basic select menu with some css added.  
fullcalendar-semantic-ui:  the dropdown menu is based on the semantic ui library  
fullcalendar-bootstrap-select: the dropdown menu is based on the bootstrap select library  
fullcalendar-div-button: button as div element to pick up the months. It is still has not all functionalities  

For all dependancies just download the repo.
